          <p>Dabra is a startup founded by SAP employees and funded by SAP. Dabra's four founders are based in Ra'anana, Israel, and their goal is to improve workplace relationships by focusing on one-one-one (1:1) meetings. Why focus on 1:1 meetings? Because they play a key role in the development of workplace relationships. The product is</p>

          <p>Dabra is a mobile-friendly web application to set shared meeting agendas; it suggests previously discussed topics when preparing for upcoming meetings and provides selfd-disclosed behavioral insights. These insights give the meeting attendees context about each other for personalized conversations.</p>

          <li>Managers are primarily focused on people and their development. They want to always be ready to make their team members successful in their work.</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="spacing-m">We decided to focus primarily on managers, as they have more points of contact and leverage to drive adoption by inviting their team members.</p>

        <h2 class="h2 spacing-s">The product MVP</h2>
          <p>Dabra went through a couple of iterations before taking off. The first one was a Slack chatbot that reminded managers to prepare for their 1:1 meetings and keep track of their notes. After this iteration didn’t work, the product evolved into an email assistant with similar capabilities, but it was not efficient enough for managers to keep track of all meetings notes either. The product evolved once again into a note-taking web application, this time getting tremendous positive user feedback.</p>

          <img class="image" src="images/dabra/evolution.png">

          <p>The product MVP was developed with a basic interface built using <a class="a-active" href="https://quasar.dev/" target="_blank">Quasar</a>—an open-source framework powered by the Vue framework. Cards were used as the main UI element to give structure to the content and act as containers for different information levels. Meeting cards (1st level), contained topic cards (2nd level), which also contained note cards (3rd level).</p>

          <p>Users loved the 'Revisit topic' feature. It consisted in typing a topic and receiving suggestions of previously discussed topics. This saved users time to go through their notes to find what had been previously discussed. The MVP was also designed with some wrong assumptions. The expectation was that users would mainly take notes on their phones during meetings. The metrics revealed Dabra was used ~85% of the time on desktop, and only ~15% on mobile. After some conversations with users, we concluded that</p>

          </div>
          <p>The card structure of the application had very generous spacing between notes and buttons—for fat thumbs using mobile devices. Users complained about having to look at their screens too often during their meetings to scroll through a few notes.</p>

          <p>After testing the options with users I concluded the third option was the best, because the private area was located where users would actually need it, and it was added as a secondary meeting tab.</p>
          <p class="spacing-m">To create more information density, I changed the card-based UI by removing the meeting and topic containers in order to give the app a text editor appearance. Typeface became an important element in the UI as the big bold titles became the natural transition between meetings. Finally, we introduced the notes history view, which consisted in a timeline of notes added to a recurrent topic throughout all the meetings. This became one of the product’s hottest features.</p>

          <p>The Dabra logo used to be a friendly-looking bot, but it didn’t match the product redesign anymore. The logo I proposed carried the same personality as the previous one, but it was simpler and communicated an emotion rather than the medium (a chatbot). Visually, the colon idea came from the way users usually abbreviate their 1:1 meetings subjects; this means using the colon in between the attendees’ names:</p>

          <li>Working remotely: it requires extra effort to communicate clearly. I learned to set intentional time to explain my thought process.</li>
          <li>Working with a front-end developer: it helped me learn a lot about how to develop responsive web applications more efficiently.</li>
          <li>Scrappy research: I had to get creative to research and test my designs by reaching out to those whose profile would fit our manager persona.</li>
          <li>Design advocacy: as the only designer in the team, I became the spokesperson of the product inside and outside SAP.</li>
