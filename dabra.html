          <h2 class="h2 spacing-s">The challenge</h2>
          <p>The workplace has become increasingly collaborative and meetings have become the main context in which our relationships develop. The problem is that many of us usually have days full of back-to-back meetings, in which proper preparation for meetings feels impossible. Others just don’t prepare due to other seemingly more important tasks.</p>
          <p class="spacing-s">Dabra aims to facilitate better workplace relationships by focusing on recurrent one-on-one (1:1) meetings, providing the tools to grow in effectiveness and empathy. How does it work? It provides a collaborative and private area for setting the meeting agenda and suggesting previously discussed topics when preparing for an upcoming meeting. With behavioral insights, Dabra also provides valuable information about colleagues which gives context for personalized conversations.</p>

      <div class="medium-12 columns">
          <h2 class="h2 spacing-s">Two personas</h2>
          <p>Dabra addresses two personas: managers and team members. Even though both benefit from better 1:1 meetings, they have different motivations. We decided to focus primarily on managers, as they would drive adoption by inviting their team members to Dabra.</p>

    <div id="3" class="row spacing-l index-item">
      <div class="medium-12 columns">
        <h2 class="h2 spacing-s">The product MVP</h2>
          <p>The first product iteration was a Slack chatbot that reminded managers to prepare for their 1:1 meetings and keep track of their notes on a Slack conversation. However, managers didn’t interact with the chatbot regularly, one of the team’s key initial assumptions. The product pivoted into an email assistant instead, but was not efficient enough for managers to keep track of all meetings notes, scattered throughout countless emails. Dabra pivoted once again into a note-taking web application. This time, the user feedback was tremendously possitive. Users found it much more useful because they had a single platform to manage all their content.</p>

          <img class="image" src="images/dabra/evolution.png">

          <p>The product MVP was a progressive web application, with a a basic interface built using <a class="a-active" href="https://quasar.dev/" target="_blank">Quasar</a>—an open-source framework powered by Vue. The structure of the application worked using cards. Every meeting contained topics, which also contained notes. One of the main actions was revisiting previous topics, which users found very useful. On the downside, there were multiple assumptions made when this MVP was created that were wrong. We thought users would mainly take notes on their phones during meetings led to a mobile-first design approach. After diving into the usage statistics, the data revealed Dabra was used ~85% of the time on desktop, and only ~15% on mobile. Generous spacing between notes and buttons for fat thumbs made several users complain the content took too much space in their laptop screens, which required scrolling even through few notes.</p></p>

        <h2 class="h2 spacing-s">Taking it to the next level</h2>
          <p>In order to create more information density, I decided to change the card-like structure of the UI by removing the meeting and topic containers. The intention was to give the app an ‘open-text’ feel but still using independent input field components. The gradient background was applied to the left panel to give the product more personality. Typeface became an important element in the UI. Without strong dividers or containers, the big bold titles became the natural transition between one meeting and the next.</p>

        <h2 class="h2 spacing-s">Happy branding</h2>
          <p>In its former interations, Dabra was personified by a friendly robot that became Dabra’s isotype as well. The team referred to the product as a ‘personal assistant’. But this concept didn’t fit the latest iteration of the product, so the brand needed to evolve, as well as the brand language and communication.</p>
          <p>The first concept I proposed was two overlapping speech bubbles forming an uppercase D, where Dabra stays in the center of the conversation but in a secondary place. After serious consideration, this option was discarded because speech bubbles are already used in many applications. The second proposal used a colon and uppercase d (:D), taken from the way users usually express the subject of one-on-one meetings. If Dabra is included on the meeting subject, the happy face appears:</p>
          <p>This last concept seemed much more promising and in line with what we have thought of the product since the beginning. Dabra’s CEO, Vitaly Vainer, was particularly excited about this option. It showed much more potential as it is less generic, but still very fun and relatable. It dramatically breaks with the visual trend in enterprise software in its lack of emotion.</p>

          <li>Working remotely requires extra effort to communicate clearly! Not only do I needed to present well-made prototypes, but also to set intentional time to explain my thought process.</li>
          <li>Having a dedicated front-end developer working alongside with me was pretty cool. I learned lots about how to develop responsive web applications much more efficiently through my designs.</li>
          <li>In a fast-paced young startup you have to get creative to research and prove your concepts and designs.</li>
          <li>As the only designer, I was proud to be the spokesperson of the brand and loved evangelizing it across the Dabra team, the SAP.iO team, and our wonderful users!</li>
