            <p>It is SAP’s annual customer experience conference, which takes place in Orlando, Florida. It targets SAP customers who are interested in current and  future technologies SAP is building to improve customer experience. It is the main stage to showcase future partnerships, exciting new technology and ideas. For startups using SAP technology or targeting similar markets, it is the opportunity to gain traction.</p>

            <h2 class="h2 spacing-s">Fellowship goals</h2>
            <p>In 2018, one of the main talking points in the conference was the SAP Cloud Platform Extension Factory, also known as Kyma, which allows to extend applications with serverless functions and microservices. Kyma enables startups to integrate their systems with the larger SAP ecosystem much more easily. To showcase Kyma, SAP CX Labs wanted to demonstrate how some startups have already integrated with the SAP Cloud Platform through a series of demos.</p>
            <p>We supported 2 startups in their product presentations, working under the guidance of David Brockington, the Head of Innovation Ecosystem at SAP CX Labs. We had multiple remote meetings with their executives to define the goals and narrative for each presentation. The companies I worked with were Thinfilm, a San Jose-based company bringing NFC technology to packaging and wearable devices;  and Brickwork Software, a New York-based startup blending the checkout experience of physical products and in-store events.</p>

        <div class="medium-8 medium-push-2 columns">
            <h2 class="h2 spacing-s">‘Tap to’ consumer experience</h2>
            <p>Thinfilm’s value proposition is to transform any non-electronic consumer good into one, by adding a unique NFC tag to every item in a concealed manner, providing—both the customer and the seller—valuable contextual actionable information. In spite of this, Thinfilm’s initial presentation proposal related to the use of electronic devices, such as kitchen fans and other kitchen appliances. The problem we saw in this approach was that users might already expect these appliances to have a certain level of connectivity, which watered down the ‘wow’ effect we wanted to convey.</p>
            <p>We wanted to give Thinfilm’s presentation that surprise effect that their competitors did not have. So, we thought of replacing these appliances with a another item that would fulfill some requirements:</p>
            <ul class="bullets">
              <li>does not have any electronic parts and internet connectivity,</li>
              <li>consumers are emotionally related to,</li>
              <li>and are of everyday use.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After a series of ideas, we thought protein powder was an item that ticked all the boxes. We came up with a fictional protein powder brand called MuscleUp, around which we tailored the narrative.</p>
            <p>The experience starts at a convenience store, where our customer persona, Jordan, is looking for a protein powder jar. As he walks through the store aisle, he finds the MuscleUp whey protein jar, which catches his attention because it’s package prompts him to tap it with his phone. He taps the jar with his phone and he’s asked if he wants to open a link in the browser. He accepts and is taken to a site that contains information about that specific product, some marketing videos, reviews, and other content that wouldn’t fit in the product packaging alone.</p>
            <p>The site has a feature to compare multiple MuscleUp products. Jordan taps two more jars, and he is shown a comparison table with the information of the whey, casein and mixed protein jars he just tapped. At this moment, the system recognizes that the customer is highly interested in purchasing the product, so Jordan receives a 50% discount coupon. This in-context promotion benefits both the brand and the customer, who gets a good deal.</p>
            <p>Once Jordan is at home, he taps the jar with his phone once again. The system asks Jordan to enable location settings, and to create an account with MuscleUp, which does. After that, he is redirected to MuscleUp site, where he can see in-context information about the product he now owns: recipes, exercise routines, the expiration date, etc. Some time later, Jordan taps the jar and is shown a notification that indicates that product is about to expire and with the option to reorder instantly. Jordan proceeds to fill out his information to reorder a new protein jar.</p>
            <p>The new protein powder jar is delivered to his address, but he realizes he was sent the wrong product. Jordan taps the jar and taps the support option. He enters a live chat with a brand representative who reviews his case. The representative can see that the item Jordan ordered differs from the one he tapped, so he instantly proceeds to send a complementary product to his address.</p>
            <p>After this presentation took place, Thinfilm changed its value proposition to high-capacity and ultra-thin lithium batteries.</p>

            <p>Brickwork Software is a New-York based company that provides a unified checkout experience to customers purchasing both physical items and in-person experiences offered on the same e-commerce site. Examples of these in-person experiences include NikeLab training session, fitting appointments at Kate Spade, Bonobo’s personal shopping experiences, Bassett’s design consultations, etc.</p>
            <p>We wanted to give Thinfilm’s presentation that surprise effect that their competitors did not have. So, we thought of replacing these appliances with a another item that would fulfill some requirements:</p>
            <p>During the development of this presentation, the Chief Innovation Officer of SAP Customer Experience—Eugenio Cassiano, and Brickwork’s founder and CEO—David Munczinski—were personally involved and who I met with a few times. </p>
