        <h2 class="h3">The challenge of work meetings</h2>
        <p>The workplace has become increasingly collaborative and work meetings have become one of the main environments in which our workplace relationships develop. However, people in management roles usually have tight work schedules with days full of back-to-back meetings, in which proper preparation for meetings feels impossible. Others just don’t prepare due to other seemingly more important tasks.</p>
        <p>Dabra aims to facilitate better workplace relationships by focusing on recurrent meetings. Dabra provides users with tools to grow in effectiveness and empathy during these meetings. It works by providing a collaborative and private area for setting the meeting agenda and suggesting previously discussed topics when preparing for an upcoming meeting. With behavioral insights, Dabra also provides valuable information about colleagues which gives context for personalized conversations.</p>

        <h2 class="h3">An evolving product</h2>
        <p>As new assumptions, use cases, and personas evolved, the Dabra product experience evolved through three critical phases. Roughly speaking, there are two personas Dabra addresses:</p>
        <p>The first iteration was a Slack chatbot which reminded managers to prepare for their one-on-one. Meetings and keep track of their notes on a Slack conversation. However, managers didn’t interact with the chatbot regularly, one of the team’s key initial assumptions. The product pivoted into an email assistant instead, but was not efficient enough for managers to keep track of all meetings notes, scattered throughout countless emails. Dabra pivoted once again into a progressive web application. This time, users found it much more useful as they had a single platform to manage all their content.</p>
        <p>The product was facing several challenges, with assumptions that were later proven to be wrong or incomplete. The progressive web application had a basic interface built using Quasar, an open-source framework powered by Vue. The assumption that users would mainly take notes on their phones during meetings led to a mobile-first design approach. After diving into the usage statistics, the data revealed Dabra was used ~85% of the time on desktop, and only ~15% on mobile. Generous spacing between notes and buttons for fat thumbs made several users complain the content took too much space in their laptop screens, which required scrolling even through few notes.</p>
        <p>In order to create more information density, I decided to change the card-like structure of the UI by removing the meeting and topic containers. The intention was to give the app an ‘open-text’ feel but still using independent input field components. The gradient background was applied to the left panel to give the product more personality. Typeface became an important element in the UI. Without strong dividers or containers, the big bold titles became the natural transition between one meeting and the next.</p>
